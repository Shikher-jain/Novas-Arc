On Windows, Python must be a DLL to handle importing modules that are themselves DLLâs. (This is the first key undocumented fact.) Instead, link to python NN .dll ; it is typically installed in C:\\Windows\\System . NN is the Python version, a number such as â33â for Python 3.3. You can link to Python in two different ways. Load-time linking means linking against python NN .lib , while run-time linking means linking against python NN .dll . (General note: python NN .lib is the so-called âimport libâ corresponding to python NN .dll . It merely defines symbols for the linker.) Run-time linking greatly simplifies link options; everything happens at run time. Your code must load python NN .dll using the Windows LoadLibraryEx() routine. The code must also use access routines and data in python NN .dll (that is, Pythonâs C APIâs) using pointers obtained by the Windows GetProcAddress() routine. Macros can make using these pointers transparent to any C code that calls routines in Pythonâs C API. Do not build Python into your .exe file directly. not python NN .dll C:\\Windows\\System You can link to Python in two different ways. It merely defines symbols for the linker.) python NN .lib python NN .dll python NN .lib python NN .dll Run-time linking greatly simplifies link options; everything happens at run time. python NN .dll LoadLibraryEx() python NN .dll GetProcAddress() If you use SWIG, it is easy to create a Python âextension moduleâ that will make the appâs data and methods available to Python. SWIG will handle just about all the grungy details for you. The result is C code that you link into your .exe file (!) You do not have to create a DLL file, and this also simplifies linking. If you use SWIG, it is easy to create a Python âextension moduleâ that will make the appâs data and methods available to Python. not SWIG will create an init function (a C function) whose name depends on the name of the extension module. For example, if the name of the module is leo, the init function will be called initleo(). If you use SWIG shadow classes, as you should, the init function will be called initleoc(). This initializes a mostly hidden helper class used by the shadow class. The reason you can link the C code in step 2 into your .exe file is that calling the initialization function is equivalent to importing the module into Python! (This is the second key undocumented fact.) SWIG will create an init function (a C function) whose name depends on the name of the extension module. (This is the second key undocumented fact.) In short, you can use the following code to initialize the Python interpreter with your extension module. #include <Python.h> ... Py_Initialize (); // Initialize Python. initmyAppc (); // Initialize (import) the helper class. PyRun_SimpleString ( \"import myApp\" ); // Import the shadow class. In short, you can use the following code to initialize the Python interpreter with your extension module. There are two problems with Pythonâs C API which will become apparent if you use a compiler other than MSVC, the compiler used to build pythonNN.dll. Problem 1: The so-called âVery High Levelâ functions that take FILE * arguments will not work in a multi-compiler environment because each compilerâs notion of a struct FILE will be different. From an implementation standpoint these are very low level functions. Problem 2: SWIG generates the following code when generating wrappers to void functions: Py_INCREF ( Py_None ); _resultobj = Py_None ; return _resultobj ; Alas, Py_None is a macro that expands to a reference to a complex data structure called _Py_NoneStruct inside pythonNN.dll. Again, this code will fail in a mult-compiler environment. Replace such code by: return Py_BuildValue ( \"\" ); It may be possible to use SWIGâs %typemap command to make the change automatically, though I have not been able to get this to work (Iâm a complete SWIG newbie). FILE * struct FILE Problem 2: SWIG generates the following code when generating wrappers to void functions: Py_INCREF ( Py_None ); _resultobj = Py_None ; return _resultobj ; Py_INCREF ( Py_None ); _resultobj = Py_None ; return _resultobj ; Py_INCREF ( Py_None ); _resultobj = Py_None ; return _resultobj ; Alas, Py_None is a macro that expands to a reference to a complex data structure called _Py_NoneStruct inside pythonNN.dll.

Rather, you (or the wxPythonWindow class) should create a ânativeâ interpreter window. It is easy to connect that window to the Python interpreter. You can redirect Pythonâs i/o to _any_ object that supports read and write, so all you need is a Python object (defined in your extension module) that contains read() and write() methods. Using a Python she will script to put up a Python interpreter window from inside your Windows app is not a good idea; the resulting window will be independent of your appâs windowing system. The FAQ does not recommend using tabs, and the Python style guide, PEP 8 , recommends 4 spaces for distributed Python code; this is also the Emacs python-mode default. PEP 8 Under any editor, mixing tabs and spaces is a bad idea. MSVC is no different in this respect, and is easily configured to use spaces: Take Tools â£ Options â£ Tabs , and for file type âDefaultâ set âTab sizeâ and âIndent sizeâ to 4, and select the âInsert spacesâ radio button.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is Python a good language for beginning programmers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes. It is still common to start students with a procedural and statically typed language such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java. Students may be better served by learning Python as their first language. Python has a very simple and consistent syntax and a large standard library and, most importantly, using Python in a beginning programming course let us students concentrate on important programming skills such as problem decomposition and data type design. With Python, students can be quickly introduced to basic concepts such as loops and procedures. They can probably even work with user-defined objects in their very first course. For a student who has never programmed before, using a statically typed language seems unnatural. It presents additional complexity that the student must master and slows the pace of the course. The students are trying to learn to think like a computer, decompose problems, design consistent interfaces, and encapsulate data. While learning to use a statically typed language is important in the long term, it is not necessarily the best topic to address in the studentsâ first programming course. Many other aspects of Python make it a good first language. Like Java, Python has a large standard library so that students can be assigned programming projects very early in the course that do something. Assignments arenât restricted to the standard four-function calculator and check balancing programs. By using the standard library, students can gain the satisfaction of working on realistic applications as they learn the fundamentals of programming. Using the standard library also teaches students about code reuse. Third-party modules such as PyGame are also helpful in extending the studentsâ reach. Pythonâs interactive interpreter enables students to test language features while theyâre programming. They can keep a window with the interpreter running while they enter their programâs source in another window. If they canât remember the methods for a list, they can do something like this: >>> L = >>> dir ( L ) >>> >>> help ( L . append ) Help on built-in function append: append(...) L.append(object) -> None -- append object to end >>> L . append ( 1 ) >>> L With the interpreter, documentation is never far from the student as they are programming. There are also good IDEs for Python. IDLE is a cross-platform IDE for Python that is written in Python using Tkinter. Emacs users will be happy to know that there is a very good Python mode for Emacs. All of these programming environments provide syntax highlighting, auto-indenting, and access to the interactive interpreter while coding.

With the approval of PEP 703 work is now underway to remove the GIL from the CPython implementation of Python. Initially it will be implemented as an optional compiler flag when building the interpreter, and so separate builds will be available with and without the GIL. Long-term, the hope is to settle on a single build, once the performance implications of removing the GIL are fully understood. Python 3.13 is likely to be the first release containing this work, although it may not be completely functional in this release. The current work to remove the GIL is based on a fork of Python 3.9 with the GIL removed by Sam Gross. Prior to that, in the days of Python 1.5, Greg Stein actually implemented a comprehensive patch set (the âfree threadingâ patches) that removed the GIL and replaced it with fine-grained locking. Adam Olsen did a similar experiment in his python-safethread project. Unfortunately, both of these earlier experiments exhibited a sharp drop in single-thread performance (at least 30% slower), due to the amount of fine-grained locking necessary to compensate for the removal of the GIL. The Python 3.9 fork is the first attempt at removing the GIL with an acceptable performance impact. The presence of the GIL in current Python releases doesnât mean that you canât make good use of Python on multi-CPU machines! You just have to be creative with dividing the work up between multiple processes rather than multiple threads . The ProcessPoolExecutor class in the new concurrent.futures module provides an easy way of doing so; the multiprocessing module provides a lower-level API in case you want more control over dispatching of tasks. Judicious use of C extensions will also help; if you use a C extension to perform a time-consuming task, the extension can release the GIL while the thread of execution is in the C code and allow other threads to get some work done. Some standard library modules such as zlib and hashlib already do this. An alternative approach to reducing the impact of the GIL is to make the GIL a per-interpreter-state lock rather than truly global. This was first implemented in Python 3.12 and is available in the C API. A Python interface to it is expected in Python 3.13. The main limitation to it at the moment is likely to be 3rd party extension modules, since these must be written with multiple interpreters in mind in order to be usable, so many older extension modules will not be usable."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "My program is too slow. How do I speed it up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thatâs a tough one, in general. First, here are a list of things to remember before diving further: Performance characteristics vary across Python implementations. This FAQ focuses on CPython . Behaviour can vary across operating systems, especially when talking about I/O or multi-threading. You should always find the hot spots in your program before attempting to optimize any code (see the profile module). Writing benchmark scripts will allow you to iterate quickly when searching for improvements (see the timeit module). It is highly recommended to have good code coverage (through unit testing or any other technique) before potentially introducing regressions hidden in sophisticated optimizations. That being said, there are many tricks to speed up Python code. Here are some general principles which go a long way towards reaching acceptable performance levels: Making your algorithms faster (or changing to faster ones) can yield much larger benefits than trying to sprinkle micro-optimization tricks all over your code. Use the right data structures. Study documentation for the Built-in Types and the collections module. When the standard library provides a primitive for doing something, it is likely (although not guaranteed) to be faster than any alternative you may come up with. This is doubly true for primitives written in C, such as builtins and some extension types. For example, be sure to use either the list.sort() built-in method or the related sorted() function to do sorting (and see the Sorting Techniques for examples of moderately advanced usage). Abstractions tend to create indirections and force the interpreter to work more. If the levels of indirection outweigh the amount of useful work done, your program will be slower. You should avoid excessive abstraction, especially under the form of tiny functions or methods (which are also often detrimental to readability). If you have reached the limit of what pure Python can allow, there are tools to take you further away. For example, Cython can compile a slightly modified version of Python code into a C extension, and can be used on many different platforms. Cython can take advantage of compilation (and optional type annotations) to make your code significantly faster than when interpreted. If you are confident in your C programming skills, you can also write a C extension module yourself. See also The wiki page devoted to performance tips ."}]}
