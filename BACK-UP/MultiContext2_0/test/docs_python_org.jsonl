B is the minor version number â it is incremented for less earth-shattering changes. C is the micro version number â it is incremented for each bugfix release. Not all releases are bugfix releases. In the run-up to a new feature release, a series of development releases are made, denoted as alpha, beta, or release candidate. Alphas are early releases in which interfaces arenât yet finalized; itâs not unexpected to see an interface change between two alpha releases. Betas are more stable, preserving existing interfaces but possibly adding new modules, and release candidates are frozen, making no changes except as needed to fix critical bugs. Alpha, beta and release candidate versions have an additional suffix: The suffix for an alpha version is âaNâ for some small number N . The suffix for a beta version is âbNâ for some small number N . The suffix for a release candidate version is ârcNâ for some small number N . In other words, all versions labeled 2.0aN precede the versions labeled 2.0bN , which precede versions labeled 2.0rcN , and those precede 2.0. You may also find version numbers with a â+â suffix, e.g. â2.2+â. These are unreleased versions, built directly from the CPython development repository. In practice, after a final minor release is made, the version is incremented to the next minor version, which becomes the âa0â version, e.g. â2.4a0â. See the Developerâs Guide for more information about the development cycle, and PEP 387 to learn more about Pythonâs backward compatibility policy.

It is still common to start students with a procedural and statically typed language such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java. Students may be better served by learning Python as their first language. Python has a very simple and consistent syntax and a large standard library and, most importantly, using Python in a beginning programming course let us students concentrate on important programming skills such as problem decomposition and data type design. With Python, students can be quickly introduced to basic concepts such as loops and procedures. They can probably even work with user-defined objects in their very first course. For a student who has never programmed before, using a statically typed language seems unnatural. It presents additional complexity that the student must master and slows the pace of the course. The students are trying to learn to think like a computer, decompose problems, design consistent interfaces, and encapsulate data. While learning to use a statically typed language is important in the long term, it is not necessarily the best topic to address in the studentsâ first programming course. Many other aspects of Python make it a good first language. Like Java, Python has a large standard library so that students can be assigned programming projects very early in the course that do something. Assignments arenât restricted to the standard four-function calculator and check balancing programs. By using the standard library, students can gain the satisfaction of working on realistic applications as they learn the fundamentals of programming. Using the standard library also teaches students about code reuse. Third-party modules such as PyGame are also helpful in extending the studentsâ reach. Pythonâs interactive interpreter enables students to test language features while theyâre programming. They can keep a window with the interpreter running while they enter their programâs source in another window. If they canât remember the methods for a list, they can do something like this: >>> L = >>> dir ( L ) >>> >>> help ( L . append ) Help on built-in function append: append(...) L.append(object) -> None -- append object to end >>> L . append ( 1 ) >>> L With the interpreter, documentation is never far from the student as they are programming. There are also good IDEs for Python. IDLE is a cross-platform IDE for Python that is written in Python using Tkinter. Emacs users will be happy to know that there is a very good Python mode for Emacs. All of these programming environments provide syntax highlighting, auto-indenting, and access to the interactive interpreter while coding. Consult the Python wiki for a full list of Python editing environments. If you want to discuss Pythonâs use in education, you may be interested in joining the edu-sig mailing list ."}]}

So, how do you arrange for the interpreter to handle your Python?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "First, you need to make sure that your command window recognises the word âpyâ as an instruction to start the interpreter. If you have opened a command window, you should try entering the command py and hitting return: py C:\\Users\\YourName> py C:\\Users\\YourName> py C:\\Users\\YourName> You should then see something like: Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) on win32 Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information. >>> Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) on win32 Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information. >>> You have started the interpreter in âinteractive modeâ. That means you can enter Python statements or expressions interactively and have them executed or evaluated while you wait. This is one of Pythonâs strongest features. Check it by entering a few expressions of your choice and seeing the results: >>> print ( \"Hello\" ) Hello >>> \"Hello\" * 3 'HelloHelloHello' >>> print ( \"Hello\" ) Hello >>> \"Hello\" * 3 'HelloHelloHello' >>> print ( \"Hello\" ) Hello >>> \"Hello\" * 3 'HelloHelloHello' Many people use the interactive mode as a convenient yet highly programmable calculator. When you want to end your interactive Python session, call the exit() function or hold the Ctrl key down while you enter a Z , then hit the â Enter â key to get back to your Windows command prompt. exit() You may also find that you have a Start-menu entry such as Start â£ Programs â£ Python 3.x â£ Python (command line) that results in you seeing the >>> prompt in a new window. If so, the window will disappear after you call the exit() function or enter the Ctrl - Z character; Windows is running a single âpythonâ command in the window, and closes it when you terminate the interpreter. Start â£ Programs â£ Python 3.x â£ Python (command line) >>> exit() Now that we know the py command is recognized, you can give your Python script to it. Youâll have to give either an absolute or a relative path to the Python script. Letâs say your Python script is located in your desktop and is named hello.py , and your command prompt is nicely opened in your home directory so youâre seeing something similar to: py hello.py C:\\Users\\YourName> C:\\Users\\YourName> So now youâll ask the py command to give your script to Python by typing py followed by your script path: py py C:\\Users\\YourName> py Desktop\\hello.py hello C:\\Users\\YourName> py Desktop\\hello.py hello On Windows, the standard Python installer already associates the .py extension with a file type (Python.File) and gives that file type an open command that runs the interpreter ( D:\\Program Files\\Python\\python.exe \"%1\" %* ). This is enough to make scripts executable from the command prompt as âfoo.pyâ. If youâd rather be able to execute the script by simple typing âfooâ with no extension you need to add .py to the PATHEXT environment variable.

This is made even more puzzling because Python will work fine on other Windows systems which appear to be configured identically. The problem may be caused by a misconfiguration of virus checking software on the problem machine. Some virus scanners have been known to introduce startup overhead of two orders of magnitude when the scanner is configured to monitor all reads from the filesystem. Try checking the configuration of virus scanning software on your systems to ensure that they are indeed configured identically. McAfee, when configured to scan all file system read activity, is a particular offender."}]}

In a DLL, linkage is declared in the source code with __declspec(dllexport) . In a .pyd, linkage is defined in a list of available functions. import foo __declspec(dllexport) Embedding the Python interpreter in a Windows app can be summarized as follows: Do not build Python into your .exe file directly. On Windows, Python must be a DLL to handle importing modules that are themselves DLLâs. (This is the first key undocumented fact.) Instead, link to python NN .dll ; it is typically installed in C:\\Windows\\System . NN is the Python version, a number such as â33â for Python 3.3. You can link to Python in two different ways. Load-time linking means linking against python NN .lib , while run-time linking means linking against python NN .dll . (General note: python NN .lib is the so-called âimport libâ corresponding to python NN .dll . It merely defines symbols for the linker.) Run-time linking greatly simplifies link options; everything happens at run time. Your code must load python NN .dll using the Windows LoadLibraryEx() routine. The code must also use access routines and data in python NN .dll (that is, Pythonâs C APIâs) using pointers obtained by the Windows GetProcAddress() routine. Macros can make using these pointers transparent to any C code that calls routines in Pythonâs C API. Do not build Python into your .exe file directly. not python NN .dll C:\\Windows\\System You can link to Python in two different ways. It merely defines symbols for the linker.) python NN .lib python NN .dll python NN .lib python NN .dll Run-time linking greatly simplifies link options; everything happens at run time. python NN .dll LoadLibraryEx() python NN .dll GetProcAddress() If you use SWIG, it is easy to create a Python âextension moduleâ that will make the appâs data and methods available to Python. SWIG will handle just about all the grungy details for you. The result is C code that you link into your .exe file (!) You do not have to create a DLL file, and this also simplifies linking. If you use SWIG, it is easy to create a Python âextension moduleâ that will make the appâs data and methods available to Python. not SWIG will create an init function (a C function) whose name depends on the name of the extension module. For example, if the name of the module is leo, the init function will be called initleo(). If you use SWIG shadow classes, as you should, the init function will be called initleoc(). This initializes a mostly hidden helper class used by the shadow class. The reason you can link the C code in step 2 into your .exe file is that calling the initialization function is equivalent to importing the module into Python! (This is the second key undocumented fact.) SWIG will create an init function (a C function) whose name depends on the name of the extension module. (This is the second key undocumented fact.) In short, you can use the following code to initialize the Python interpreter with your extension module. #include <Python.h> ... Py_Initialize (); // Initialize Python. initmyAppc (); // Initialize (import) the helper class. PyRun_SimpleString ( \"import myApp\" ); // Import the shadow class. In short, you can use the following code to initialize the Python interpreter with your extension module. There are two problems with Pythonâs C API which will become apparent if you use a compiler other than MSVC, the compiler used to build pythonNN.dll. Problem 1: The so-called âVery High Levelâ functions that take FILE * arguments will not work in a multi-compiler environment because each compilerâs notion of a struct FILE will be different. From an implementation standpoint these are very low level functions. Problem 2: SWIG generates the following code when generating wrappers to void functions: Py_INCREF ( Py_None ); _resultobj = Py_None ; return _resultobj ; Alas, Py_None is a macro that expands to a reference to a complex data structure called _Py_NoneStruct inside pythonNN.dll. Again, this code will fail in a mult-compiler environment. Replace such code by: return Py_BuildValue ( \"\" ); It may be possible to use SWIGâs %typemap command to make the change automatically, though I have not been able to get this to work (Iâm a complete SWIG newbie). FILE * struct FILE Problem 2: SWIG generates the following code when generating wrappers to void functions: Py_INCREF ( Py_None ); _resultobj = Py_None ; return _resultobj ; Py_INCREF ( Py_None ); _resultobj = Py_None ; return _resultobj ; Py_INCREF ( Py_None ); _resultobj = Py_None ; return _resultobj ; Alas, Py_None is a macro that expands to a reference to a complex data structure called _Py_NoneStruct inside pythonNN.dll.

Rather, you (or the wxPythonWindow class) should create a ânativeâ interpreter window. It is easy to connect that window to the Python interpreter. You can redirect Pythonâs i/o to _any_ object that supports read and write, so all you need is a Python object (defined in your extension module) that contains read() and write() methods. Using a Python she will script to put up a Python interpreter window from inside your Windows app is not a good idea; the resulting window will be independent of your appâs windowing system. The FAQ does not recommend using tabs, and the Python style guide, PEP 8 , recommends 4 spaces for distributed Python code; this is also the Emacs python-mode default. PEP 8 Under any editor, mixing tabs and spaces is a bad idea. MSVC is no different in this respect, and is easily configured to use spaces: Take Tools â£ Options â£ Tabs , and for file type âDefaultâ set âTab sizeâ and âIndent sizeâ to 4, and select the âInsert spacesâ radio button. Tools â£ Options â£ Tabs Python raises IndentationError or TabError if mixed tabs and spaces are causing problems in leading whitespace. You may also run the tabnanny module to check a directory tree in batch mode. IndentationError TabError tabnanny Use the msvcrt module. This is a standard Windows-specific extension module.

The first is done by executing chmod +x scriptfile or perhaps chmod 755 scriptfile . The second can be done in a number of ways. The most straightforward way is to write #!/usr/local/bin/python as the very first line of your file, using the pathname for where the Python interpreter is installed on your platform. If you would like the script to be independent of where the Python interpreter lives, you can use the env program. Almost all Unix variants support the following, assuming the Python interpreter is in a directory on the userâs PATH : #!/usr/bin/env python Donât do this for CGI scripts. The PATH variable for CGI scripts is often very minimal, so you need to use the actual absolute pathname of the interpreter. Occasionally, a userâs environment is so full that the /usr/bin/env program fails; or thereâs no env program at all. In that case, you can try the following hack (due to Alex Rezinsky): #! /bin/sh \"\"\":\" exec python $0 ${ 1 + \" $@ \" } \"\"\" The minor disadvantage is that this defines the scriptâs __doc__ string.

The doctest module finds examples in the docstrings for a module and runs them, comparing the output with the expected output given in the docstring. The unittest module is a fancier testing framework modelled on Java and Smalltalk testing frameworks. To make testing easier, you should use good modular design in your program. Your program should have almost all functionality encapsulated in either functions or class methods â and this sometimes has the surprising and delightful effect of making the program run faster (because local variable accesses are faster than global accesses). Furthermore the program should avoid depending on mutating global variables, since this makes testing much more difficult to do. The âglobal main logicâ of your program may be as simple as if __name__ == \"__main__\" : main_logic () at the bottom of the main module of your program. Once your program is organized as a tractable collection of function and class behaviours, you should write test functions that exercise the behaviours. A test suite that automates a sequence of tests can be associated with each module. This sounds like a lot of work, but since Python is so terse and flexible itâs surprisingly easy. You can make coding much more pleasant and fun by writing your test functions in parallel with the âproduction codeâ, since this makes it easy to find bugs and even design flaws earlier. âSupport modulesâ that are not intended to be the main module of a program may include a self-test of the module. if __name__ == \"__main__\" : self_test () Even programs that interact with complex external interfaces may be tested when the external interfaces are unavailable by using âfakeâ interfaces implemented in Python."}]}

In general, Python offers to switch among threads only between bytecode instructions; how frequently it switches can be set via sys.setswitchinterval() . Each bytecode instruction and therefore all the C implementation code reached from each instruction is therefore atomic from the point of view of a Python program. In theory, this means an exact accounting requires an exact understanding of the PVM bytecode implementation. In practice, it means that operations on shared variables of built-in data types (ints, lists, dicts, etc) that âlook atomicâ really are. For example, the following operations are all atomic (L, L1, L2 are lists, D, D1, D2 are dicts, x, y are objects, i, j are ints): L . append ( x ) L1 . extend ( L2 ) x = L x = L . pop () L1 = L2 L . sort () x = y x . field = y D = y D1 . update ( D2 ) D . keys () These arenât: i = i + 1 L . append ( L ) L = L D = D + 1 Operations that replace other objects may invoke those other objectsâ __del__() method when their reference count reaches zero, and that can affect things.

With the approval of PEP 703 work is now underway to remove the GIL from the CPython implementation of Python. Initially it will be implemented as an optional compiler flag when building the interpreter, and so separate builds will be available with and without the GIL. Long-term, the hope is to settle on a single build, once the performance implications of removing the GIL are fully understood. Python 3.13 is likely to be the first release containing this work, although it may not be completely functional in this release. The current work to remove the GIL is based on a fork of Python 3.9 with the GIL removed by Sam Gross. Prior to that, in the days of Python 1.5, Greg Stein actually implemented a comprehensive patch set (the âfree threadingâ patches) that removed the GIL and replaced it with fine-grained locking. Adam Olsen did a similar experiment in his python-safethread project. Unfortunately, both of these earlier experiments exhibited a sharp drop in single-thread performance (at least 30% slower), due to the amount of fine-grained locking necessary to compensate for the removal of the GIL. The Python 3.9 fork is the first attempt at removing the GIL with an acceptable performance impact. The presence of the GIL in current Python releases doesnât mean that you canât make good use of Python on multi-CPU machines! You just have to be creative with dividing the work up between multiple processes rather than multiple threads . The ProcessPoolExecutor class in the new concurrent.futures module provides an easy way of doing so; the multiprocessing module provides a lower-level API in case you want more control over dispatching of tasks. Judicious use of C extensions will also help; if you use a C extension to perform a time-consuming task, the extension can release the GIL while the thread of execution is in the C code and allow other threads to get some work done. Some standard library modules such as zlib and hashlib already do this. An alternative approach to reducing the impact of the GIL is to make the GIL a per-interpreter-state lock rather than truly global. This was first implemented in Python 3.12 and is available in the C API. A Python interface to it is expected in Python 3.13. The main limitation to it at the moment is likely to be 3rd party extension modules, since these must be written with multiple interpreters in mind in order to be usable, so many older extension modules will not be usable."}]}

This also happens automatically in f âs destructor, when f becomes garbage. But stdin, stdout and stderr are treated specially by Python, because of the special status also given to them by C. Running sys.stdout.close() marks the Python-level file object as being closed, but does not close the associated C file descriptor. To close the underlying C file descriptor for one of these three, you should first be sure thatâs what you really want to do (e.g., you may confuse extension modules trying to do I/O).

You can check if an object is an instance of any of a number of classes by providing a tuple instead of a single class, e.g. isinstance(obj, (class1, class2, ...)) , and can also check whether an object is one of Pythonâs built-in types, e.g. isinstance(obj, str) or isinstance(obj, (int, float, complex)) . isinstance(obj, cls) isinstance(obj, (class1, class2, ...)) isinstance(obj, str) isinstance(obj, (int, float, complex)) Note that isinstance() also checks for virtual inheritance from an abstract base class . So, the test will return True for a registered class even if hasnât directly or indirectly inherited from it. To test for âtrue inheritanceâ, scan the MRO of the class: isinstance() abstract base class True MRO from collections.abc import Mapping class P : pass class C ( P ): pass Mapping . register ( P ) from collections.abc import Mapping class P : pass class C ( P ): pass Mapping . register ( P ) >>> c = C () >>> isinstance ( c , C ) # direct True >>> isinstance ( c , P ) # indirect True >>> isinstance ( c , Mapping ) # virtual True # Actual inheritance chain >>> type ( c ) . __mro__ (<class 'C'>, <class 'P'>, <class 'object'>) # Test for \"true inheritance\" >>> Mapping in type ( c ) . __mro__ False >>> c = C () >>> isinstance ( c , C ) # direct True >>> isinstance ( c , P ) # indirect True >>> isinstance ( c , Mapping ) # virtual True # Actual inheritance chain >>> type ( c ) . __mro__ False Note that most programs do not use isinstance() on user-defined classes very often. If you are developing the classes yourself, a more proper object-oriented style is to define methods on the classes that encapsulate a particular behaviour, instead of checking the objectâs class and doing a different thing based on what class it is. For example, if you have a function that does something: isinstance() def search ( obj ): if isinstance ( obj , Mailbox ): ... # code to search a mailbox elif isinstance ( obj , Document ): ... # code to search a document elif ... def search ( obj ): if isinstance ( obj , Mailbox ): ... A better approach is to define a search() method on all the classes and just call it: search() class Mailbox : def search ( self ): ... # code to search a mailbox class Document : def search ( self ): ... # code to search a document obj . search () class Mailbox : def search ( self ): ... search () Delegation is an object oriented technique (also called a design pattern). Letâs say you have an object x and want to change the behaviour of just one of its methods. You can create a new class that provides a new implementation of the method youâre interested in changing and delegates all other methods to the corresponding method of x . x x Python programmers can easily implement delegation. For example, the following class implements a class that behaves like a file but converts all written data to uppercase: class UpperOut : def __init__ ( self , outfile ): self . _outfile = outfile def write ( self , s ): self . _outfile . write ( s . upper ()) def __getattr__ ( self , name ): return getattr ( self . _outfile , name ) class UpperOut : def __init__ ( self , outfile ): self . _outfile , name ) Here the UpperOut class redefines the write() method to convert the argument string to uppercase before calling the underlying self._outfile.write() method. All other methods are delegated to the underlying self._outfile object. The delegation is accomplished via the __getattr__() method; consult the language reference for more information about controlling attribute access. UpperOut write() self._outfile.write() self._outfile __getattr__() the language reference Note that for more general cases delegation can get trickier. When attributes must be set as well as retrieved, the class must define a __setattr__() method too, and it must do so carefully. The basic implementation of __setattr__() is roughly equivalent to the following: __setattr__() __setattr__() class X : ... def __setattr__ ( self , name , value ): self . __dict__ = value ... class X : ... __dict__   = value ... Many __setattr__() implementations call object.__setattr__() to set an attribute on self without causing infinite recursion: __setattr__() object.__setattr__() class X : def __setattr__ ( self , name , value ): # Custom logic here... object . __setattr__ ( self , name , value ) class X : def __setattr__ ( self , name , value ): # Custom logic here... __setattr__ ( self , name , value ) Alternatively, it is possible to set attributes by inserting entries into self.__dict__ directly. self.__dict__ Use the built-in super() function: super() class Derived ( Base ): def meth ( self ): super () . meth () # calls Base.meth class Derived ( Base ): def meth ( self ): super () . meth () # calls Base.meth In the example, super() will automatically determine the instance from which it was called (the self value), look up the method resolution order (MRO) with type(self).__mro__ , and return the next in line after Derived in the MRO: Base . super() self method resolution order type(self).__mro__ Derived Base You could assign the base class to an alias and derive from the alias. Then all you have to change is the value assigned to the alias. Incidentally, this trick is also handy if you want to decide dynamically (e.g. depending on availability of resources) which base class to use. Example: class Base : ... BaseAlias = Base class Derived ( BaseAlias ): ... class Base : ... Both static data and static methods (in the sense of C++ or Java) are supported in Python. For static data, simply define a class attribute. To assign a new value to the attribute, you have to explicitly use the class name in the assignment: class C : count = 0 # number of times C.__init__ called def __init__ ( self ): C . count = C . count + 1 def getcount ( self ): return C . count # or return self.count class C : count = 0 # number of times C.__init__ called def __init__ ( self ): C . count # or return self.count c.count also refers to C.count for any c such that isinstance(c, C) holds, unless overridden by c itself or by some class on the base-class search path from c.__class__ back to C . c.count C.count c isinstance(c, C) c c.__class__ C Caution: within a method of C, an assignment like self.count = 42 creates a new and unrelated instance named âcountâ in self âs own dict. Rebinding of a class-static data name must always specify the class whether inside a method or not: self.count = 42 self C . count = 314 C . count = 314 Static methods are possible: class C : @staticmethod def static ( arg1 , arg2 , arg3 ): # No 'self' parameter! ... class C : @staticmethod def static ( arg1 , arg2 , arg3 ): # No 'self' parameter! However, a far more straightforward way to get the effect of a static method is via a simple module-level function: def getcount (): return C . count def getcount (): return C . count If your code is structured so as to define one class (or tightly related class hierarchy) per module, this supplies the desired encapsulation. This answer actually applies to all methods, but the question usually comes up first in the context of constructors. In C++ youâd write class C { C () { cout << \"No arguments \\n \" ; } C ( int i ) { cout << \"Argument is \" << i << \" \\n \" ; } } class C { C () { cout << \"No arguments \\n \" ; } C ( int i ) { cout << \"Argument is \" << i << \" \\n \" ; } } class C { C () { cout << \"No arguments \\n \" ; } C ( int i ) { cout << \"Argument is \" << i << \" \\n \" ; } } In Python you have to write a single constructor that catches all cases using default arguments. For example: class C : def __init__ ( self , i = None ): if i is None : print ( \"No arguments\" ) else : print ( \"Argument is\" , i ) class C : def __init__ ( self , i = None ): if i is None : print ( \"No arguments\" ) else : print ( \"Argument is\" , i ) class C : def __init__ ( self , i = None ): if i is None : print ( \"No arguments\" ) else : print ( \"Argument is\" , i ) This is not entirely equivalent, but close enough in practice. You could also try a variable-length argument list, e.g. def __init__ ( self , * args ): ... The same approach works for all method definitions. Variable names with double leading underscores are âmangledâ to provide a simple but effective way to define class private variables. Any identifier of the form __spam (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with _classname__spam , where classname is the current class name with any leading underscores stripped. __spam _classname__spam classname The identifier can be used unchanged within the class, but to access it outside the class, the mangled name must be used: class A : def __one ( self ): return 1 def two ( self ): return 2 * self . __one () class B ( A ): def three ( self ): return 3 * self . _A__one () four = 4 * A () . _A__one () class A : def __one ( self ): return 1 def two ( self ): return 2 * self . _A__one () In particular, this does not guarantee privacy since an outside user can still deliberately access the private attribute; many Python programmers never bother to use private variable names at all. See also The private name mangling specifications for details and special cases. private name mangling specifications There are several possible reasons for this. The del statement does not necessarily call __del__() â it simply decrements the objectâs reference count, and if this reaches zero __del__() is called. del __del__() __del__() If your data structures contain circular links (e.g. a tree where each child has a parent reference and each parent has a list of children) the reference counts will never go back to zero. Once in a while Python runs an algorithm to detect such cycles, but the garbage collector might run some time after the last reference to your data structure vanishes, so your __del__() method may be called at an inconvenient and random time. This is inconvenient if youâre trying to reproduce a problem. Worse, the order in which objectâs __del__() methods are executed is arbitrary. You can run gc.collect() to force a collection, but there are pathological cases where objects will never be collected. __del__() __del__() gc.collect() Despite the cycle collector, itâs still a good idea to define an explicit close() method on objects to be called whenever youâre done with them. The close() method can then remove attributes that refer to subobjects. Donât call __del__() directly â __del__() should call close() and close() should make sure that it can be called more than once for the same object. close() close() __del__() __del__() close() close() Another way to avoid cyclical references is to use the weakref module, which allows you to point to objects without incrementing their reference count. Tree data structures, for instance, should use weak references for their parent and sibling references (if they need them!). weakref Finally, if your __del__() method raises an exception, a warning message is printed to sys.stderr . __del__() sys.stderr Python does not keep track of all instances of a class (or of a built-in type). You can program the classâs constructor to keep track of all instances by keeping a list of weak references to each instance. id() The id() builtin returns an integer that is guaranteed to be unique during the lifetime of the object. Since in CPython, this is the objectâs memory address, it happens frequently that after an object is deleted from memory, the next freshly created object is allocated at the same position in memory. This is illustrated by this example: id() >>> id ( 1000 ) 13901272 >>> id ( 2000 ) 13901272 >>> id ( 1000 ) 13901272 >>> id ( 2000 ) 13901272 >>> id ( 1000 ) 13901272 >>> id ( 2000 ) 13901272 The two ids belong to different integer objects that are created before, and deleted immediately after execution of the id() call. To be sure that objects whose id you want to examine are still alive, create another reference to the object: id() >>> a = 1000 ; b = 2000 >>> id ( a ) 13901272 >>> id ( b ) 13891296 >>> a = 1000 ; b = 2000 >>> id ( a ) 13901272 >>> id ( b ) 13891296 >>> a = 1000 ; b = 2000 >>> id ( a ) 13901272 >>> id ( b ) 13891296 The is operator tests for object identity. The test a is b is equivalent to id(a) == id(b) . is a is b id(a) == id(b) The most important property of an identity test is that an object is always identical to itself, a is a always returns True . Identity tests are usually faster than equality tests. And unlike equality tests, identity tests are guaranteed to return a boolean True or False . a is a True True False However, identity tests can only be substituted for equality tests when object identity is assured. Generally, there are three circumstances where identity is guaranteed: Assignments create new names but do not change object identity. After the assignment new = old , it is guaranteed that new is old . Assignments create new names but do not change object identity. new = old new is old Putting an object in a container that stores object references does not change object identity. After the list assignment s = x , it is guaranteed that s is x . Putting an object in a container that stores object references does not change object identity. s = x s is x If an object is a singleton, it means that only one instance of that object can exist. After the assignments a = None and b = None , it is guaranteed that a is b because None is a singleton. If an object is a singleton, it means that only one instance of that object can exist. a = None b = None a is b None In most other circumstances, identity tests are inadvisable and equality tests are preferred. In particular, identity tests should not be used to check constants such as int and str which arenât guaranteed to be singletons: int str >>> a = 1000 >>> b = 500 >>> c = b + 500 >>> a is c False >>> a = 'Python' >>> b = 'Py' >>> c = b + 'thon' >>> a is c False >>> a = 1000 >>> b = 500 >>> c = b + 500 >>> a is c False >>> a = 'Python' >>> b = 'Py' >>> c = b + 'thon' >>> a is c False >>> a = 1000 >>> b = 500 >>> c = b + 500 >>> a is c False >>> a = 'Python' >>> b = 'Py' >>> c = b + 'thon' >>> a is c False Likewise, new instances of mutable containers are never identical: >>> a = >>> b = >>> a is b False >>> a = >>> b = >>> a is b False >>> a = >>> b = >>> a is b False In the standard library code, you will see several common patterns for correctly using identity tests: As recommended by PEP 8 , an identity test is the preferred way to check for None . This reads like plain English in code and avoids confusion with other objects that may have boolean values that evaluate to false. As recommended by PEP 8 , an identity test is the preferred way to check for None . PEP 8 None Detecting optional arguments can be tricky when None is a valid input value. In those situations, you can create a singleton sentinel object guaranteed to be distinct from other objects. For example, here is how to implement a method that behaves like dict.pop() : _sentinel = object () def pop ( self , key , default = _sentinel ): if key in self : value = self del self return value if default is _sentinel : raise KeyError ( key ) return default Detecting optional arguments can be tricky when None is a valid input value. For example, here is how to implement a method that behaves like dict.pop() : None dict.pop() _sentinel = object () def pop ( self , key , default = _sentinel ): if key in self : value = self del self return value if default is _sentinel : raise KeyError ( key ) return default _sentinel = object () def pop ( self , key , default = _sentinel ): if key in self : value = self del self return value if default is _sentinel : raise KeyError ( key ) return default _sentinel = object () def pop ( self , key , default = _sentinel ): if key in self : value = self   del self   return value if default is _sentinel : raise KeyError ( key ) return default Container implementations sometimes need to augment equality tests with identity tests. This prevents the code from being confused by objects such as float('NaN') that are not equal to themselves. Container implementations sometimes need to augment equality tests with identity tests. float('NaN') For example, here is the implementation of collections.abc.Sequence.__contains__() : collections.abc.Sequence.__contains__() def __contains__ ( self , value ): for v in self : if v is value or v == value : return True return False def __contains__ ( self , value ): for v in self : if v is value or v == value : return True return False def __contains__ ( self , value ): for v in self : if v is value or v == value : return True return False When subclassing an immutable type, override the __new__() method instead of the __init__() method. The latter only runs after an instance is created, which is too late to alter data in an immutable instance. __new__() __init__() All of these immutable classes have a different signature than their parent class: from datetime import date class FirstOfMonthDate ( date ): \"Always choose the first day of the month\" def __new__ ( cls , year , month , day ): return super () . __new__ ( cls , year , month , 1 ) class NamedInt ( int ): \"Allow text names for some numbers\" xlat = { 'zero' : 0 , 'one' : 1 , 'ten' : 10 } def __new__ ( cls , value ): value = cls . xlat . get ( value , value ) return super () . __new__ ( cls , value ) class TitleStr ( str ): \"Convert str to name suitable for a URL path\" def __new__ ( cls , s ): s = s . lower () . replace ( ' ' , '-' ) s = '' . join ( ) return super () . __new__ ( cls , s ) from datetime import date class FirstOfMonthDate ( date ): \"Always choose the first day of the month\" def __new__ ( cls , year , month , day ): return super () . __new__ ( cls , s ) The classes can be used like this: >>> FirstOfMonthDate ( 2012 , 2 , 14 ) FirstOfMonthDate(2012, 2, 1) >>> NamedInt ( 'ten' ) 10 >>> NamedInt ( 20 ) 20 >>> TitleStr ( 'Blog: Why Python Rocks' ) 'blog-why-python-rocks' >>> FirstOfMonthDate ( 2012 , 2 , 14 ) FirstOfMonthDate(2012, 2, 1) >>> NamedInt ( 'ten' ) 10 >>> NamedInt ( 20 ) 20 >>> TitleStr ( 'Blog: Why Python Rocks' ) 'blog-why-python-rocks' >>> FirstOfMonthDate ( 2012 , 2 , 14 ) FirstOfMonthDate(2012, 2, 1) >>> NamedInt ( 'ten' ) 10 >>> NamedInt ( 20 ) 20 >>> TitleStr ( 'Blog: Why Python Rocks' ) 'blog-why-python-rocks' The two principal tools for caching methods are functools.cached_property() and functools.lru_cache() . The former stores results at the instance level and the latter at the class level. functools.cached_property() functools.lru_cache() The cached_property approach only works with methods that do not take any arguments. It does not create a reference to the instance. The cached method result will be kept only as long as the instance is alive. The advantage is that when an instance is no longer used, the cached method result will be released right away. The disadvantage is that if instances accumulate, so too will the accumulated method results. They can grow without bound. The lru_cache approach works with methods that have hashable arguments. It creates a reference to the instance unless special efforts are made to pass in weak references. hashable The advantage of the least recently used algorithm is that the cache is bounded by the specified maxsize . The disadvantage is that instances are kept alive until they age out of the cache or until the cache is cleared. This example shows the various techniques: class Weather : \"Lookup weather information on a government website\" def __init__ ( self , station_id ): self . _station_id = station_id # The _station_id is private and immutable def current_temperature ( self ): \"Latest hourly observation\" # Do not cache this because old results # can be out of date. @cached_property def location ( self ): \"Return the longitude/latitude coordinates of the station\" # Result only depends on the station_id @lru_cache ( maxsize = 20 ) def historic_rainfall ( self , date , units = 'mm' ): \"Rainfall on a given date\" # Depends on the station_id, date, and units. class Weather : \"Lookup weather information on a government website\" def __init__ ( self , station_id ): self . The above example assumes that the station_id never changes. If the relevant instance attributes are mutable, the cached_property approach canât be made to work because it cannot detect changes to the attributes. To make the lru_cache approach work when the station_id is mutable, the class needs to define the __eq__() and __hash__() methods so that the cache can detect relevant attribute updates: __eq__() __hash__() class Weather : \"Example with a mutable station identifier\" def __init__ ( self , station_id ): self . station_id = station_id def change_station ( self , station_id ): self . station_id = station_id def __eq__ ( self , other ): return self . station_id == other . station_id def __hash__ ( self ): return hash ( self . station_id ) @lru_cache ( maxsize = 20 ) def historic_rainfall ( self , date , units = 'cm' ): 'Rainfall on a given date' # Depends on the station_id, date, and units. class Weather : \"Example with a mutable station identifier\" def __init__ ( self , station_id ): self . When a module is imported for the first time (or when the source file has changed since the current compiled file was created) a .pyc file containing the compiled code should be created in a __pycache__ subdirectory of the directory containing the .py file. The .pyc file will have a filename that starts with the same name as the .py file, and ends with .pyc , with a middle component that depends on the particular python binary that created it. (See PEP 3147 for details.) .pyc __pycache__ .py .pyc .py .pyc python PEP 3147 One reason that a .pyc file may not be created is a permissions problem with the directory containing the source file, meaning that the __pycache__ subdirectory cannot be created. This can happen, for example, if you develop as one user but run as another, such as if you are testing with a web server. .pyc __pycache__ Unless the PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE environment variable is set, creation of a .pyc file is automatic if youâre importing a module and Python has the ability (permissions, free space, etcâ¦) to create a __pycache__ subdirectory and write the compiled module to that subdirectory. PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE __pycache__ Running Python on a top level script is not considered an import and no .pyc will be created. For example, if you have a top-level module foo.py that imports another module xyz.py , when you run foo (by typing python foo.py as a she will command), a .pyc will be created for xyz because xyz is imported, but no .pyc file will be created for foo since foo.py isnât being imported. .pyc foo.py xyz.py foo python foo.py .pyc xyz xyz .pyc foo foo.py If you need to create a .pyc file for foo â that is, to create a .pyc file for a module that is not imported â you can, using the py_compile and compileall modules. .pyc foo .pyc py_compile compileall The py_compile module can manually compile any module. One way is to use the compile() function in that module interactively: py_compile compile() >>> import py_compile >>> py_compile . compile ( 'foo.py' ) >>> import py_compile >>> py_compile . compile ( 'foo.py' ) This will write the .pyc to a __pycache__ subdirectory in the same location as foo.py (or you can override that with the optional parameter cfile ). .pyc __pycache__ foo.py cfile You can also automatically compile all files in a directory or directories using the compileall module. You can do it from the she will prompt by running compileall.py and providing the path of a directory containing Python files to compile: compileall compileall.py python - m compileall . python - m compileall . A module can find out its own module name by looking at the predefined global variable __name__ . If this has the value '__main__' , the program is running as a script. Many modules that are usually used by importing them also provide a command-line interface or a self-test, and only execute this code after checking __name__ : __name__ '__main__' __name__ def main (): print ( 'Running test...' ) ... if __name__ == '__main__' : main () def main (): print ( 'Running test...' ) ... if __name__ == '__main__' : main () Suppose you have the following modules: foo.py : foo.py from bar import bar_var foo_var = 1 from bar import bar_var foo_var = 1 from bar import bar_var foo_var = 1 bar.py : bar.py from foo import foo_var bar_var = 2 from foo import foo_var bar_var = 2 from foo import foo_var bar_var = 2 The problem is that the interpreter will perform the following steps: main imports foo main imports foo foo Empty globals for foo are created Empty globals for foo are created foo foo is compiled and starts executing foo is compiled and starts executing foo foo imports bar foo imports bar foo bar Empty globals for bar are created Empty globals for bar are created bar bar is compiled and starts executing bar is compiled and starts executing bar bar imports foo (which is a no-op since there already is a module named foo ) bar imports foo (which is a no-op since there already is a module named foo ) bar foo foo The import mechanism tries to read foo_var from foo globals, to set bar.foo_var = foo.foo_var The import mechanism tries to read foo_var from foo globals, to set bar.foo_var = foo.foo_var foo_var foo bar.foo_var = foo.foo_var The last step fails, because Python isnât done with interpreting foo yet and the global symbol dictionary for foo is still empty. foo foo The same thing happens when you use import foo , and then try to access foo.foo_var in global code. import foo foo.foo_var There are (at least) three possible workarounds for this problem. Guido van Rossum recommends avoiding all uses of from <module> import ... , and placing all code inside functions. Initializations of global variables and class variables should use constants or built-in functions only. This means everything from an imported module is referenced as <module>.<name> . from <module> import ... <module>.<name> Jim Roskind suggests performing steps in the following order in each module: exports (globals, functions, and classes that donât need imported base classes) exports (globals, functions, and classes that donât need imported base classes) import statements import statements import active code (including globals that are initialized from imported values). active code (including globals that are initialized from imported values). Van Rossum doesnât like this approach much because the imports appear in a strange place, but it does work. Matthias Urlichs recommends restructuring your code so that the recursive import is not necessary in the first place. These solutions are not mutually exclusive. Consider using the convenience function import_module() from importlib instead: import_module() importlib z = importlib . import_module ( 'x.y.z' ) z = importlib . import_module ( 'x.y.z' ) For reasons of efficiency as well as consistency, Python only reads the module file on the first time a module is imported. If it didnât, in a program consisting of many modules where each one imports the same basic module, the basic module would be parsed and re-parsed many times. To force re-reading of a changed module, do this: import importlib import modname importlib . reload ( modname ) import importlib import modname importlib . reload ( modname ) Warning: this technique is not 100% fool-proof. In particular, modules containing statements like from modname import some_objects from modname import some_objects from modname import some_objects will continue to work with the old version of the imported objects. If the module contains class definitions, existing class instances will not be updated to use the new class definition. This can result in the following paradoxical behaviour: >>> import importlib >>> import cls >>> c = cls . C () # Create an instance of C >>> importlib . reload ( cls ) <module 'cls' from 'cls.py'> >>> isinstance ( c , cls ."}]}

However, when you actually try you will see that they all return 16 : >>> squares () 16 >>> squares () 16 This happens because x is not local to the lambdas, but is defined in the outer scope, and it is accessed when the lambda is called â not when it is defined. At the end of the loop, the value of x is 4 , so all the functions now return 4**2 , i.e. 16 . You can also verify this by changing the value of x and see how the results of the lambdas change: >>> x = 8 >>> squares () 64 In order to avoid this, you need to save the values in variables local to the lambdas, so that they donât rely on the value of the global x : >>> squares = >>> for x in range ( 5 ): ... append ( lambda n = x : n ** 2 ) Here, n=x creates a new variable n local to the lambda and computed when the lambda is defined so that it has the same value that x had at that point in the loop.

Doing so clutters the importerâs namespace, and makes it much harder for linters to detect undefined names. Import modules at the top of a file. Doing so makes it clear what other modules your code requires and avoids questions of whether the module name is in scope. Using one import per line makes it easy to add and delete module imports, but using multiple imports per line uses less screen space. Itâs good practice if you import modules in the following order: standard library modules â e.g. sys , os , argparse , re third-party library modules (anything installed in Pythonâs site-packages directory) â e.g. dateutil , requests , PIL.Image locally developed modules It is sometimes necessary to move imports to a function or class to avoid problems with circular imports. Gordon McMillan says: In this case, if the second module is only used in one function, then the import can easily be moved into that function. By the time the import is called, the first module will have finished initializing, and the second module can do its import. It may also be necessary to move imports out of the top level of code if some of the modules are platform-specific. In that case, it may not even be possible to import all of the modules at the top of the file. In this case, importing the correct modules in the corresponding platform-specific code is a good option. Only move imports into a local scope, such as inside a function definition, if itâs necessary to solve a problem such as avoiding a circular import or are trying to reduce the initialization time of a module. This technique is especially helpful if many of the imports are unnecessary depending on how the program executes. You may also want to move imports into a function if the modules are only ever used in that function. Note that loading a module the first time may be expensive because of the one time initialization of the module, but loading a module multiple times is virtually free, costing only a couple of dictionary lookups. Even if the module name has gone out of scope, the module is probably available in sys.modules ."}]}

Consider this function: def foo ( mydict = {}): # Danger: shared reference to one dict for all calls ... compute something ... mydict = value return mydict The first time you call this function, mydict contains a single item. The second time, mydict contains two items because when foo() begins executing, mydict starts out with an item already in it. It is often expected that a function call creates new objects for default values. This is not what happens. Default values are created exactly once, when the function is defined. If that object is changed, like the dictionary in this example, subsequent calls to the function will refer to this changed object. By definition, immutable objects such as numbers, strings, tuples, and None , are safe from change. Changes to mutable objects such as dictionaries, lists, and class instances can lead to confusion. Because of this feature, it is good programming practice to not use mutable objects as default values. Instead, use None as the default value and inside the function, check if the parameter is None and create a new list/dictionary/whatever if it is. For example, donât write: def foo ( mydict = {}): ... but: def foo ( mydict = None ): if mydict is None : mydict = {} # create a new dict for local namespace This feature can be useful. When you have a function thatâs time-consuming to compute, a common technique is to cache the parameters and the resulting value of each call to the function, and return the cached value if the same value is requested again. This is called âmemoizingâ, and can be implemented like this: # Callers can only provide two parameters and optionally pass _cache by keyword def expensive ( arg1 , arg2 , * , _cache = {}): if ( arg1 , arg2 ) in _cache : return _cache # Calculate the value result = ... expensive computation ... _cache = result # Store result in the cache return result You could use a global variable containing a dictionary instead of the default value; itâs a matter of taste."}]}

There are two factors that produce this result: Variables are simply names that refer to objects. Doing y = x doesnât create a copy of the list â it creates a new variable y that refers to the same object x refers to. This means that there is only one object (the list), and both x and y refer to it. Lists are mutable , which means that you can change their content. After the call to append() , the content of the mutable object has changed from to . Since both the variables refer to the same object, using either name accesses the modified value . If we instead assign an immutable object to x : >>> x = 5 # ints are immutable >>> y = x >>> x = x + 1 # 5 cannot be mutated, we are creating a new object here >>> x 6 >>> y 5 we can see that in this case x and y are not equal anymore. This is because integers are immutable , and when we do x = x + 1 we are not mutating the int 5 by incrementing its value; instead, we are creating a new object (the int 6 ) and assigning it to x (that is, changing which object x refers to). After this assignment we have two objects (the ints 6 and 5 ) and two variables that refer to them ( x now refers to 6 but y still refers to 5 ). Some operations (for example y.append(10) and y.sort() ) mutate the object, whereas superficially similar operations (for example y = y + and sorted(y) ) create a new object. In general in Python (and in all cases in the standard library) a method that mutates an object will return None to help avoid getting the two types of operations confused. So if you mistakenly write y.sort() thinking it will give you a sorted copy of y , youâll instead end up with None , which will likely because your program to generate an easily diagnosed error. However, there is one class of operations where the same operation sometimes has different behaviors with different types: the augmented assignment operators. For example, += mutates lists but not tuples or ints ( a_list += is equivalent to a_list.extend( ) and mutates a_list , whereas some_tuple += (1, 2, 3) and some_int += 1 create new objects). In other words: If we have a mutable object ( list , dict , set , etc.), we can use some specific operations to mutate it and all the variables that refer to it will see the change. If we have an immutable object ( str , int , tuple , etc.), all the variables that refer to it will always see the same value, but operations that transform that value into a new value always return a new object. If you want to know if two variables refer to the same object or not, you can use the is operator, or the built-in function id() ."}]}

By returning a tuple of the results: >>> def func1 ( a , b ): ... a = 'new-value' # a and b are local names ... b = b + 1 # assigned to new objects ... return a , b # return new values ... >>> x , y = 'old-value' , 99 >>> func1 ( x , y ) ('new-value', 100) This is almost always the clearest solution.

How do I speed it up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thatâs a tough one, in general. First, here are a list of things to remember before diving further: Performance characteristics vary across Python implementations. This FAQ focuses on CPython . Behaviour can vary across operating systems, especially when talking about I/O or multi-threading. You should always find the hot spots in your program before attempting to optimize any code (see the profile module). Writing benchmark scripts will allow you to iterate quickly when searching for improvements (see the timeit module). It is highly recommended to have good code coverage (through unit testing or any other technique) before potentially introducing regressions hidden in sophisticated optimizations. That being said, there are many tricks to speed up Python code. Here are some general principles which go a long way towards reaching acceptable performance levels: Making your algorithms faster (or changing to faster ones) can yield much larger benefits than trying to sprinkle micro-optimization tricks all over your code. Use the right data structures. Study documentation for the Built-in Types and the collections module. When the standard library provides a primitive for doing something, it is likely (although not guaranteed) to be faster than any alternative you may come up with. This is doubly true for primitives written in C, such as builtins and some extension types. For example, be sure to use either the list.sort() built-in method or the related sorted() function to do sorting (and see the Sorting Techniques for examples of moderately advanced usage). Abstractions tend to create indirections and force the interpreter to work more. If the levels of indirection outweigh the amount of useful work done, your program will be slower. You should avoid excessive abstraction, especially under the form of tiny functions or methods (which are also often detrimental to readability). If you have reached the limit of what pure Python can allow, there are tools to take you further away. For example, Cython can compile a slightly modified version of Python code into a C extension, and can be used on many different platforms. Cython can take advantage of compilation (and optional type annotations) to make your code significantly faster than when interpreted. If you are confident in your C programming skills, you can also write a C extension module yourself. See also The wiki page devoted to performance tips ."}]}

This discussion applies in general when augmented assignment operators are applied to elements of a tuple that point to mutable objects, but weâll use a list and += as our exemplar. If you wrote: >>> a_tuple = ( 1 , 2 ) >>> a_tuple += 1 Traceback (most recent call last): ... TypeError : 'tuple' object does not support item assignment The reason for the exception should be immediately clear: 1 is added to the object a_tuple points to ( 1 ), producing the result object, 2 , but when we attempt to assign the result of the computation, 2 , to element 0 of the tuple, we get an error because we canât change what an element of a tuple points to. Under the covers, what this augmented assignment statement is doing is approximately this: >>> result = a_tuple + 1 >>> a_tuple = result Traceback (most recent call last): ... TypeError : 'tuple' object does not support item assignment It is the assignment part of the operation that produces the error, since a tuple is immutable. When you write something like: >>> a_tuple = ( , 'bar' ) >>> a_tuple += Traceback (most recent call last): ... TypeError : 'tuple' object does not support item assignment The exception is a bit more surprising, and even more surprising is the fact that even though there was an error, the append worked: >>> a_tuple To see why this happens, you need to know that (a) if an object implements an __iadd__() magic method, it gets called when the += augmented assignment is executed, and its return value is what gets used in the assignment statement; and (b) for lists, __iadd__() is equivalent to calling extend() on the list and returning the list. Thatâs why we say that for lists, += is a âshorthandâ for list.extend() : >>> a_list = >>> a_list += >>> a_list This is equivalent to: >>> result = a_list . __iadd__ ( ) >>> a_list = result The object pointed to by a_list has been mutated, and the pointer to the mutated object is assigned back to a_list . The end result of the assignment is a no-op, since it is a pointer to the same object that a_list was previously pointing to, but the assignment still happens. Thus, in our tuple example what is happening is equivalent to: >>> result = a_tuple . __iadd__ ( ) >>> a_tuple = result Traceback (most recent call last): ... TypeError : 'tuple' object does not support item assignment The __iadd__() succeeds, and thus the list is extended, but even though result points to the same object that a_tuple already points to, that final assignment still results in an error, because tuples are immutable."}]}

You can check if an object is an instance of any of a number of classes by providing a tuple instead of a single class, e.g. isinstance(obj, (class1, class2, ...)) , and can also check whether an object is one of Pythonâs built-in types, e.g. isinstance(obj, str) or isinstance(obj, (int, float, complex)) . Note that isinstance() also checks for virtual inheritance from an abstract base class . So, the test will return True for a registered class even if hasnât directly or indirectly inherited from it. To test for âtrue inheritanceâ, scan the MRO of the class: from collections.abc import Mapping class P : pass class C ( P ): pass Mapping . register ( P ) >>> c = C () >>> isinstance ( c , C ) # direct True >>> isinstance ( c , P ) # indirect True >>> isinstance ( c , Mapping ) # virtual True # Actual inheritance chain >>> type ( c ) . __mro__ (<class 'C'>, <class 'P'>, <class 'object'>) # Test for \"true inheritance\" >>> Mapping in type ( c ) . __mro__ False Note that most programs do not use isinstance() on user-defined classes very often. If you are developing the classes yourself, a more proper object-oriented style is to define methods on the classes that encapsulate a particular behaviour, instead of checking the objectâs class and doing a different thing based on what class it is. For example, if you have a function that does something: def search ( obj ): if isinstance ( obj , Mailbox ): ... # code to search a mailbox elif isinstance ( obj , Document ): ... # code to search a document elif ...

Letâs say you have an object x and want to change the behaviour of just one of its methods. You can create a new class that provides a new implementation of the method youâre interested in changing and delegates all other methods to the corresponding method of x . Python programmers can easily implement delegation. For example, the following class implements a class that behaves like a file but converts all written data to uppercase: class UpperOut : def __init__ ( self , outfile ): self . _outfile = outfile def write ( self , s ): self . _outfile . write ( s . upper ()) def __getattr__ ( self , name ): return getattr ( self . _outfile , name ) Here the UpperOut class redefines the write() method to convert the argument string to uppercase before calling the underlying self._outfile.write() method. All other methods are delegated to the underlying self._outfile object. The delegation is accomplished via the __getattr__() method; consult the language reference for more information about controlling attribute access. Note that for more general cases delegation can get trickier. When attributes must be set as well as retrieved, the class must define a __setattr__() method too, and it must do so carefully. The basic implementation of __setattr__() is roughly equivalent to the following: class X : ... def __setattr__ ( self , name , value ): self . __dict__ = value ... Many __setattr__() implementations call object.__setattr__() to set an attribute on self without causing infinite recursion: class X : def __setattr__ ( self , name , value ): # Custom logic here... object . __setattr__ ( self , name , value ) Alternatively, it is possible to set attributes by inserting entries into self.__dict__ directly."}]}

The test a is b is equivalent to id(a) == id(b) . The most important property of an identity test is that an object is always identical to itself, a is a always returns True . Identity tests are usually faster than equality tests. And unlike equality tests, identity tests are guaranteed to return a boolean True or False . However, identity tests can only be substituted for equality tests when object identity is assured. Generally, there are three circumstances where identity is guaranteed: Assignments create new names but do not change object identity. After the assignment new = old , it is guaranteed that new is old . Putting an object in a container that stores object references does not change object identity. After the list assignment s = x , it is guaranteed that s is x . If an object is a singleton, it means that only one instance of that object can exist. After the assignments a = None and b = None , it is guaranteed that a is b because None is a singleton. In most other circumstances, identity tests are inadvisable and equality tests are preferred. In particular, identity tests should not be used to check constants such as int and str which arenât guaranteed to be singletons: >>> a = 1000 >>> b = 500 >>> c = b + 500 >>> a is c False >>> a = 'Python' >>> b = 'Py' >>> c = b + 'thon' >>> a is c False Likewise, new instances of mutable containers are never identical: >>> a = >>> b = >>> a is b False In the standard library code, you will see several common patterns for correctly using identity tests: As recommended by PEP 8 , an identity test is the preferred way to check for None . This reads like plain English in code and avoids confusion with other objects that may have boolean values that evaluate to false. Detecting optional arguments can be tricky when None is a valid input value. In those situations, you can create a singleton sentinel object guaranteed to be distinct from other objects. For example, here is how to implement a method that behaves like dict.pop() : _sentinel = object () def pop ( self , key , default = _sentinel ): if key in self : value = self del self return value if default is _sentinel : raise KeyError ( key ) return default Container implementations sometimes need to augment equality tests with identity tests. This prevents the code from being confused by objects such as float('NaN') that are not equal to themselves. For example, here is the implementation of collections.abc.Sequence.__contains__() : def __contains__ ( self , value ): for v in self : if v is value or v == value : return True return False"}]}

The former stores results at the instance level and the latter at the class level. The cached_property approach only works with methods that do not take any arguments. It does not create a reference to the instance. The cached method result will be kept only as long as the instance is alive. The advantage is that when an instance is no longer used, the cached method result will be released right away. The disadvantage is that if instances accumulate, so too will the accumulated method results. They can grow without bound. The lru_cache approach works with methods that have hashable arguments. It creates a reference to the instance unless special efforts are made to pass in weak references. The advantage of the least recently used algorithm is that the cache is bounded by the specified maxsize . The disadvantage is that instances are kept alive until they age out of the cache or until the cache is cleared. This example shows the various techniques: class Weather : \"Lookup weather information on a government website\" def __init__ ( self , station_id ): self . _station_id = station_id # The _station_id is private and immutable def current_temperature ( self ): \"Latest hourly observation\" # Do not cache this because old results # can be out of date. @cached_property def location ( self ): \"Return the longitude/latitude coordinates of the station\" # Result only depends on the station_id @lru_cache ( maxsize = 20 ) def historic_rainfall ( self , date , units = 'mm' ): \"Rainfall on a given date\" # Depends on the station_id, date, and units. The above example assumes that the station_id never changes. If the relevant instance attributes are mutable, the cached_property approach canât be made to work because it cannot detect changes to the attributes. To make the lru_cache approach work when the station_id is mutable, the class needs to define the __eq__() and __hash__() methods so that the cache can detect relevant attribute updates: class Weather : \"Example with a mutable station identifier\" def __init__ ( self , station_id ): self . station_id = station_id def change_station ( self , station_id ): self . station_id = station_id def __eq__ ( self , other ): return self . station_id == other . station_id def __hash__ ( self ): return hash ( self . station_id ) @lru_cache ( maxsize = 20 ) def historic_rainfall ( self , date , units = 'cm' ): 'Rainfall on a given date' # Depends on the station_id, date, and units."}]}

This can happen, for example, if you develop as one user but run as another, such as if you are testing with a web server. Unless the PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE environment variable is set, creation of a .pyc file is automatic if youâre importing a module and Python has the ability (permissions, free space, etcâ¦) to create a __pycache__ subdirectory and write the compiled module to that subdirectory.

Many modules that are usually used by importing them also provide a command-line interface or a self-test, and only execute this code after checking __name__ : def main (): print ( 'Running test...' ) ... if __name__ == '__main__' : main ()"}]}

The same thing happens when you use import foo , and then try to access foo.foo_var in global code. There are (at least) three possible workarounds for this problem. Guido van Rossum recommends avoiding all uses of from <module> import ... , and placing all code inside functions. Initializations of global variables and class variables should use constants or built-in functions only. This means everything from an imported module is referenced as <module>.<name> . Jim Roskind suggests performing steps in the following order in each module: exports (globals, functions, and classes that donât need imported base classes) import statements active code (including globals that are initialized from imported values). Van Rossum doesnât like this approach much because the imports appear in a strange place, but it does work. Matthias Urlichs recommends restructuring your code so that the recursive import is not necessary in the first place. These solutions are not mutually exclusive."}]}

Why does this happen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For reasons of efficiency as well as consistency, Python only reads the module file on the first time a module is imported. If it didnât, in a program consisting of many modules where each one imports the same basic module, the basic module would be parsed and re-parsed many times. To force re-reading of a changed module, do this: import importlib import modname importlib . reload ( modname ) Warning: this technique is not 100% fool-proof. In particular, modules containing statements like from modname import some_objects will continue to work with the old version of the imported objects. If the module contains class definitions, existing class instances will not be updated to use the new class definition. This can result in the following paradoxical behaviour: >>> import importlib >>> import cls >>> c = cls . C () # Create an instance of C >>> importlib . reload ( cls ) <module 'cls' from 'cls.py'> >>> isinstance ( c , cls ."}]}
