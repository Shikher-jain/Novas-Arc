Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster. Here are some of the key benefits of AWS: Cost Savings: AWS offers low, pay-as-you-go pricing with no up-front expenses or long-term contracts. We are able to build and manage a global infrastructure at scale, and pass the cost saving benefits onto you in the form of lower prices. Agility and Instant Elasticity: AWS provides a massive global cloud infrastructure that allows you to quickly innovate, experiment and iterate. Instead of waiting weeks or months for hardware, you can instantly deploy new applications, instantly scale up as your workload grows, and instantly scale down based on demand. Open and Flexible: AWS is a language and operating system agnostic platform. You choose the development platform or programming model that makes the most sense for your business. You can choose which services you use, one or several, and choose how you use them. This flexibility allows you to focus on innovation, not infrastructure. Secure: AWS is a secure, durable technology platform with industry-recognized certifications and audits: PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, FISMA Moderate, FedRAMP, HIPAA, and SOC 1 (formerly referred to as SAS 70 and/or SSAE 16) and SOC 2 audit reports. Our services and data centers have multiple layers of operational and physical security to ensure the integrity and safety of your data. Ecosystem: AWS has a vibrant partner ecosystem where you can find thousands of consulting and technology partners who can help you innovate faster, reduce costs and increase agility. You can also leverage the vibrant AWS user community where millions of AWS customers share knowledge and tips. Global Reach: AWS operates 69 Availability Zones within 22 geographic Regions around the world, with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Bahrain, Indonesia, Spain, and Switzerland. Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.

(AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide a variety of basic abstract technical infrastructure and distributed computing building blocks and tools.\n\nOne of the key benefits that AWS provides is the ability to scale up or down based on demand. This allows customers to use only what they need without worrying about storage or capacity constraints.\n\nThere are many different types of services provided by AWS including: \n\n* **Compute**: Compute services like EC2 allow you to spin up servers in minutes\n* **Storage & Content Delivery**: Storage options include EBS for block storage needs \n* **Databases**: Databases options include RDS which makes it easy to set up\n* **Migration & Transfer**: Migration service can help move your data from one location to another.\n* **Networking & Content Delivery**: Networking options include VPC which lets you isolate resources into virtual networks.\n* **Management Tools**: Management tools like CloudWatch allow you to monitor all your resources in one place.\n* **Machine Learning & AI** : Machine learning service called SageMaker\n\nThese are just some examples of the wide range of services that AWS offers. The decision-making process around selecting an appropriate product would depend upon various factors such as cost savings, ease of use, performance requirements among others.\n\nIn addition, there are other considerations that come into play when choosing between different products within the same category. For example:\n- If you’re looking for a database solution with high availability but don’t want to manage infrastructure yourself then Amazon RDS could be perfect because it automates backups and software patching; \n- However if having more control over these aspects appeals then consider using Amazon EC2 with MySQL installed directly onto Windows or Linux instances;\n- Similarly when deciding between S3 object storage vs Glacier cold archiving tier think about how often data will need retrieval - if seldom go for cheaper option!\n\nWhen setting up an environment or application there are also important decisions such as which region(s) should be chosen based not just on latency concerns but regulatory compliance issues too (eg EU GDPR requires certain personal information remain within European Union).", "AWS is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 175 fully featured services from data centers globally.

To use public endpoints over the internet, your network must be configured to allow traffic destined for the service's public prefixes. You can find these on Amazon S3 IP Address Ranges and DynamoDB IP Address Ranges. When using a VPC endpoint policy to restrict access only to a specific service or account, ensure that you are allowing both Amazon S3 private IPs as well as CloudFront IPs if your application is accessing CloudFront through an Amazon S3 website hosting alias record. Internet access is required when you provision AWS services via publicly routable EIPs or Public VIFs in Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW). It’s also important when reaching out from on-premises network where DXGW has been set up with Service Provider BGP ASN being used by other customers of the same Service Provider or within another region in case of global reachability using public peering connection..", "When two instances communicate using public IP addresses or when instances communicate with a public AWS service endpoint, the traffic might go over the internet, or it might stay within the AWS network. Traffic between two AWS accounts stays within the global AWS backbone network regardless of whether you use public IP addresses or Elastic IPs. This includes communication between workloads in different Regions and availability zones (AZs). When an instance communicates with a public service endpoint such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, or Amazon CloudFront over its public IP address, your traffic will be routed outside of your VPC to reach the external service endpoint using internet transit providers. However, if both source and destination are in the same region then we try to keep traffic on our private network before it goes out to reach destination.

By default all subnets are created with main route table association which has an entry pointing 0.0.0.0/0 directly to igw-xxxxxxxx.If you want specific workloads running on EC2 instances to have access only through internal services without going over internet then consider creating additional custom route tables with more restrictive rules and associate them specifically with subnets where these workloads run.Amazon Web Services – Reduced Public Internet Access Microsoft Workloads Blueprint Page 5 of 5 To learn more about what happens behind-the-scenes at AWS networking visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvqyyzLZTbA ."], "quality_scores": {"relevance": 0.06160453334450722, "completeness": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
{"user_query": "Does traffic go over the internet when two instances communicate using public IP addresses, or when instances communicate with a public AWS service endpoint?", "model_responses": ["If the two instances are in a VPC and have public IP addresses, traffic does not go over the internet when they communicate with each other. Instead, the traffic remains within the Amazon network. When one instance sends packets to another instance's public IP address, traffic travels through Amazon’s network backbone via private networking path. Note that we do not support Inter-Region VPC Peering for IPv6 at this time.\n\nFor communication between an instance and an AWS service endpoint using a public AWS service endpoint, if both the instance and the AWS service endpoint are in regions enabled for IPv6, traffic will use Amazon's global backbone to reach its destination (IPv4 or IPv6) from either side of this connection. This is true even if one or both sides of this connection are configured with only an IPv4 address.\n\nThere is no additional charge associated with data transfer between instances communicating via their public IPs or between an instance and a public AWS service endpoint.\n\nWhen you enable ClassicLink for your VPC and connect an EC2-Classic instance to a ClassicLink-enabled VPC, your EC2-Classic instance uses its private IP address as it traverses across ClassicLink into your linked VPC; therefore all services which rely on our ability to route according to CIDR will continue working without interruption.", "When two Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances communicate with each other, the traffic traverses the global AWS network in addition to the internet. When a packet leaves an instance, it is sent to the top-of-rack router. From there it is forwarded to another router within the same Availability Zone. If you are using public IP addresses, and both instances are in the same Region, this traffic does not leave AWS's network as it traverses between routers within an Availability Zone. It also doesn't leave AWS's network if both instances are in different Availability Zones of the same Region or if they're in different Regions on the same continent.\n\nIf you have enabled DNS resolution for your VPC and created a default security group that allows all outbound traffic, your instance can access (for example) www.amazon.com through its public address by sending packets from its private IP address across AWS's network using NAT (Network Address Translation). The target destination will receive packets from a public IP address owned by Amazon Web Services Inc., which might be different every time because NAT assigns source ports randomly.\n\nIn general, when communication takes place between two resources connected via their private IPs over VPN tunnels/connections; Direct Connect connections; ClassicLink connections etc., these communications don't traverse over Internet but rather stays encapsulated on one of these private networks.\n\nIt is important to understand that although traffic may traverse over various networks when moving data from point A to B; security groups and NACLs provide control at protocol and port access level while encryption mechanisms like SSL/TLS or IPSec provide confidentiality layer required for securing application data during transit between points."], "quality_scores": {"relevance": 0.06160453334450722, "completeness": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}

{"user_query": "How do instances in a VPC access the Internet?", "model_responses": ["Instances in a VPC can be exposed to the Internet by two primary methods. The first method is to use an Elastic IP address (EIP) which allows your instance to be addressed publicly for inbound and outbound traffic. The second method is to use an Internet Gateway which establishes a target in your route table for internet-routable traffic, and allocates public IP addresses directly on the instances themselves. This solution involves multiple steps: Step 1: Allocate an EIP or Attach an EIP to the Instance An Elastic IP address (EIP) is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. With an EIP, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account. Your instances are automatically enabled to access the internet via Amazon’s network infrastructure when launched into a non-default VPC subnet; however, they cannot be reached from outside of your VPC without an Elastic IP Address (EIP) or NAT Gateway/NAT Instance. If you require internet access from these EC2 instances, associate them with a public IPv4 address or assign them an Elastic IP Address during launch. To allocate and attach an EIP using the console Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/. In the navigation pane, choose “Elastic IPs”. Choose “Allocate new address” and then choose “Allocate”. Select one of your allocated addresses and then choose “Actions”, “Associate Address”. For Instances that have been launched into a non-default subnet that has been configured with Route Tables that send all traffic destined outside their VPC through either a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW), Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW), Transit Gateway (TGW), Local Gateway(LGW), egress-only Internet gateway, NAT gateway or NAT instance located within their VPC will not have access to AWS managed services such as S3 endpoints unless they have been configured with private DNS names enabled on their ENI(s). To enable this feature please follow instructions here . Step 2: Create/Attach Internet Gateway An internet gateway serves two purposes: providing a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic, and performing network address translation for instances that use Ephemeral Ports only as described below in step 3b . You must create/attach one before you can create routes in your route table that direct traffic destined outside of your VPC. To create/attach IGW using Console Open Amazon Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/. In left navigation pane click on ‘Internet Gateways’. Click on ‘Create internet gateway’ button Enter name tag(optional) & click on ‘Create’ button Right-click on newly created IGW & select ‘Attach vpc’ option Select desired vpc from dropdown list & click ‘Attach’ button Step 3a: Update Route Table – Public Subnet A route table contains rules that control where network traffic is directed. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table; if you don’t explicitly associate a subnet with any other route table, it is implicitly associated with main route table of default VPC(vpc-xxxxxxxx). By default all subnets are associated with main/default routing table(vpc-xxxxxxxx). Main routing tables contain predefined rules including local routes for communication within attached CIDR block(s); therefore we recommend creating custom routing tables instead of modifying main routing tables so as not affect other subnets sharing same main routing table(vpc-xxxxxxxx). To update Route Table – Public Subnet Open Amazon Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/. In left navigation pane click on ‘Route Tables’. Identify correct Route Table based upon Subnet association column value Click on Routes tab below Confirm presence of following entry Destination : 0.0.0./0 Target : igw-xxxxxxx(Your IGW ID should appear here ) If above entry does not exist ,click Edit routes button followed by Add routes button Enter destination as 0..../0 & select target value matching id starting with igw-xxxxxx Click Save Routes Step 3b: Update Security Group Rules - Public Subnet Security groups act like firewalls at protocol level i.e., port level while Network Access Control Lists(NACLs) act like firewall at ip-address level i.e., subnet level . All security groups are stateful i.e., if you allow incoming traffic(EC2-V1 ←EC2-V2 ), response traffic will flow out automatically(EC2-V1 →EC2-V2 ). However NACLs are stateless i.e., if you allow incoming rule(EC2-V1 ←EC2-V2 ), outgoing rule needs explicit allowance(ECV1 →ECV22 ). Therefore we recommend using security groups instead of NACLs whenever possible because security group rules apply immediately while NACL rules take effect after few minutes post creation/modification/deletion .To update Security Group Rules - Public Subnet Open Amazon EC@ console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec@/ In left navigation pane click o n‘Security Groups’. Identify correct Security Group based upon Description column value Click o nInbound Rules tab below Confirm presence f following entries Type : HTTP Protocol : TCP Port Range :80 Source : Anywhere(Allowing world wide web(HTTP)) Type : HTTPS Protocol : TCP Port Range :443 Source:Anywhere(Allowing world wide web(HTTP)) If above entries do not exist ,click Edit inbound rules followed by Add Rule buttons Enter type as HTTP ,protocol as TCP ,port range s80& sourceasAnywhere Click Save Rule Repeat above steps but enter typeasHTTPS,port rangeas443&sourceasAnywhereClickSaveRule Note:-If there exists no Outbound Rule allowing All Traffic towards Anywhere then add one similar rule under Outbound Rules tab too!

No \nInstance does not use its public IPv4 address and traffic is destined for an Amazon S3 bucket or another resource outside of the VPC network (such as auth.s3-external-1.amazonaws.com). The traffic is routed directly out of your VPC through an egress-only internet gateway to reach AWS services powered by AWS PrivateLink and other destinations outside of your VPC network. For more information about egress-only internet gateways, see Egress-Only Internet Gateways in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide Yes \nInstance does not use its public IPv4 address and traffic is destined for anything else An instance without Public IP addresses communicates with other resources on the Internet using either NAT device or NAT service provided by AWS No \n\nIf you need connectivity between your VPC and data centers, you must set up VPN connections between your data center and each Availability Zone that contains the subnets from which you want to launch instances. Alternatively, if both networks are running IPv6 addressing, then there are no additional steps required; all resources will be able to communicate via global unique identifiers.\n\nYou may optionally assign one or more secondary private IPv4 addresses to your network interface(s) that are in addition to any automatically assigned private IP addresses already assigned to them at launch time. These secondary private IP addresses can be assigned from within or outside of CIDR block ranges associated with any of your subnets; however they must be associated with specific primary private IP addresses on those network interfaces when they are created.\n\nFor example: If you have two subnets 10.0.0/24 and 10.0/1/24 then it’s possible for one ENI attached instance launched into first subnet i.e., 10..0..0/24 could have secondary IPs belonging from second subnet i.e., 10..0..1/24 but these IPs should be associated only with primary IPs belonging from first subnet i.e., 10..0..0/24 ."], "quality_scores": {"relevance": 0.21064579486846924, "completeness": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}

Thus, an Internet gateway is not a single point of failure in the sense that if it fails, you will not be able to access the internet from your VPC; however, all instances with public IP addresses that are associated with the failed gateway will lose internet connectivity until the Internet gateway is restored.\n\nIf you have more than one subnet in a VPC and would like to route external traffic through a single subnet (for example, for monitoring purposes), you can create an additional route table for that subnet and set up a static route from that table to the Internet Gateway.\n\nYou can also use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your usage; see Monitoring Bandwidth Usage with Amazon CloudWatch in this document for more information.\n\nFor VPN connections: You should consider using AWS Direct Connect instead of a VPN connection if you require consistent high bandwidth. If you need higher availability or higher bandwidth beyond what Direct Connect can provide (up to 10 Gbps), then consider using multiple VPN connections over AWS managed VPN endpoints (see Managed Virtual Private Network (VPN) Connections)."], "quality_scores": {"relevance": -0.018673937767744064, "completeness": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
