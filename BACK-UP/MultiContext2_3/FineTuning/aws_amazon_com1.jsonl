You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address ranges, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can also create a hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your corporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud as an extension of your corporate datacenter. You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon VPC. For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that have access to the Internet, and place your backend systems such as databases or application servers in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access. You can leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet."}]}

An IPAM contains two default scopes. Each scope represents the IP space for a single network. The private scope is intended for all private space. The public scope is intended for all public space. Scopes enable you to reuse IP addresses across multiple unconnected networks without causing IP address overlap or conflict. Within a scope, you create IPAM pools. A pool is a collection of contiguous IP address ranges (or CIDRs). IPAM pools enable you to organize your IP addresses according to your routing and security needs. You can have multiple pools within a top-level pool. For example, if you have separate routing and security needs for development and production applications, you can create a pool for each. Within IPAM pools, you allocate CIDRs to AWS resources. An allocation is a CIDR assignment from an IPAM pool to another resource or IPAM pool. When you create a VPC and choose an IPAM pool for the VPC’s CIDR, the CIDR is allocated from the CIDR provisioned to the IPAM pool. You can monitor and manage the allocation with IPAM. scope private scope public scope A pool is a collection of contiguous IP address ranges (or CIDRs). pool An allocation is a CIDR assignment from an IPAM pool to another resource or IPAM pool."}]}

For example, a stateful filter that allows inbound traffic to TCP port 80 on a webserver will allow the return traffic, usually on a high numbered port (e.g., destination TCP port 63, 912) to pass through the stateful filter between the client and the webserver. The filtering device maintains a state table that tracks the origin and destination port numbers and IP addresses. Only one rule is required on the filtering device: Allow traffic inbound to the web server on TCP port 80. Stateless filtering, on the other hand, only examines the source or destination IP address and the destination port, ignoring whether the traffic is a new request or a reply to a request. In the above example, two rules would need to be implemented on the filtering device: one rule to allow traffic inbound to the web server on TCP port 80, and another rule to allow outbound traffic from the webserver (TCP port range 49, 152 through 65, 535). Only one rule is required on the filtering device: Allow traffic inbound to the web server on TCP port Stateless filtering, on the other hand, only examines the source or destination IP address and the destination port, ignoring whether the traffic is a new request or a reply to a request."}]}

This runbooks automates the steps that are required to migrate an instance from EC2-Classic to VPC by creating an AMI of the instance in EC2-Classic, creating a new instance from the AMI in VPC, and optionally terminating the EC2-Classic instance. If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact the AWS Support Team via AWS Premium Support .
