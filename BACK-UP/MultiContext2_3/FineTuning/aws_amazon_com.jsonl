Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny access to AWS resources. IAM enables security best practices by allowing you to grant unique security credentials to users and groups to specify which AWS service APIs and resources they can access. IAM access can be revoked if a user leaves the company or project, helping to ensure that root credentials are not exposed or compromised. For security and team functionality, IAM users are essential to using the full potential of your AWS account.
